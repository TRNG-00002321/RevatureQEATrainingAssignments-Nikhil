# 3. Given a string s, and a pattern p.
# You need to find if p exists in s or not and return the starting index of p in s.
# If p does not exist in s then -1 will be returned.
# Here p and s both are case-sensitive.

# Examples:
# Input: s = "Hello", p = "llo"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: llo starts from the second index in Hello.

s = "Hello"
p = "llo"

print(s.find(p))
